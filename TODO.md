# features implementations:

    - Hold click to clear all nearby cells: {
        when clicking and holding on a cell, if the number of marked neighbors is equal to the number of
        bombs nearby, then trigger the reveal function of all neighbors
    }

    - difficulty selection: {
        now that I think of it this should have been among the top priority task lol
    }

# bugs to fix:

    - cannot mark/flag tiles with a bomb {
        marking cells kinda worked better than expected
    }

# Other:

    - refractor the entire code
